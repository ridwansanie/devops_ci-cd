Responsive website!
This is a responsive Website

What's in this project?
← README.md: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← index.html: This is the main web page for your site. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page using elements. You'll see references in the HTML to the JS and CSS files. Try clicking the image in the center of the page!

← style.css: CSS files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.

← script.js: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads, and when the visitor clicks the button you can add below.

When i push code from Visual STudio to Github it will automatically deploy to github pages site
